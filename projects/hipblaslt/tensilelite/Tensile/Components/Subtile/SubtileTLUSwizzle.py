"""LDS bank-conflict swizzle for TLU=1 (NT) subtile transpose reads.

The baseline K-major LDS image maps a read half's 32 lanes onto only 32 of the
64 banks, giving a 2-way conflict.  Two transforms recover 1-way, selected by
the strip width in chunks per K-column (``cpc``): a chunk-index XOR plus
load-block pad for the narrow widths, the column-scatter layout for cpc 4 and 8.
Either way GR write and LR read agree on the LDS image -- the XOR is an
involution so both sides apply it unchanged, while col_scatter has GR
de-interleave what LR interleaves -- so A round-trips.  Unvalidated widths fall
back to no swizzle (``None``).
